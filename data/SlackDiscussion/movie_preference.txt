<<<Farhad>>>
SW could be a good option, it's the first of eight/nine movies, if you like one you could always go back and watch the other ones.

<<<Rohit>>>
Excluding holiday specials

<<<Kaizan>>>
I know it's a classic movie, but it's too old for me

<<<Farhad>>>
But that's why you have so many movies, if you don't like one of the older ones you can go and watch a new SW movie

<<<Kaizan>>>
A few of my friends watched the newest SW and they fell asleep

<<<Zhibing>>>
I think the story is interesting, but the tech is really old

<<<Rohit>>>
So if they used new gadgets, you could be interested?

<<<Farhad>>>
Is that why you liked INT, because they have new tech?

<<<Rohit>>>
It's about the future

<<<Zhibing>>>
Yeah

<<<Kaizan>>>
The CGI stuff in INT is better than SW

<<<Farhad>>>
Did you know that Kip Thorne won an Oscar for INT?

<<<Kaizan>>>
Yeah

<<<Farhad>>>
I mean, the movie is good as well

<<<Kaizan>>>
Yeah

<<<Zhibing>>>
And I liked Anne Hathaway

<<<Rohit>>>
Now we're talking!

<<<William>>>
I didn't like INT that much, I thought the plot was kind of boring

<<<Kaizan>>>
Yeah, the story wasn't interesting

<<<Zhibing>>>
I liked DM, because I like all animation.

<<<Rohit>>>
I also liked DM, cute movie with minions and everything

<<<Zhibing>>>
And Agnes is really cute, I liked that

<<<Farhad>>>
I liked DM, but did not like Minions. I liked Gru though.

<<<Farhad>>>
I did not like TAR. It was beautiful to watch, but I felt like Avatar was a really boring film

<<<Kaizan>>>
In terms of story, MAT or INC was better

<<<Farhad>>>
FG as well, right?

<<<Kaizan>>>
I haven't watched FG

<<<Farhad>>>
In terms of story, the first MAT movie was really good

<<<Kaizan>>>
I mean first time you do not understand it

<<<Farhad>>>
And then you have to rewatch it. I wouldn't mind rewatching it again.

<<<Kaizan>>>
Yeah

<<<William>>>
I liked AVE. At first I didn't know much about the characters. The movie

<<<Farhad>>>
It was a great blockbuster films, lots of action, lots of aliens.

<<<Rohit>>>
All the names here were probably great blockbuster films

<<<Farhad>>>
Except for maybe LLL?

<<<Rohit>>>
But it almost won an Oscar

<<<Farhad>>>
LLL, when I watched, seemed like a Bollywood movie and that irritated me

<<<Zhibing>>>
In the beginning of the movie, when they started to sing and dance, I thought "what are they doing?"

<<<Zhibing>>>
Let's talk about INC, I liked INC

<<<Farhad>>>
I was at the edge of my seat, the whole time I was watching INC

<<<William>>>
I've heard great things about INC, I would like to watch it

<<<Rohit>>>
I would like to rewatch it as well. Even if I know the whole story, it doesn't affect my enjoyment

<<<Farhad>>>
That's true for TTN as well

<<<Kaizan>>>
But TTN is kind of not suitable for us to watch

<<<Rohit>>>
INC is good. But maybe my personal choice would be FG

<<<Farhad>>>
I would probably most prefer INC or INT
