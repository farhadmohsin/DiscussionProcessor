Hi everyone, we should talk about which restaurant we should go
I personally prefer Sunhee's Farm and Kitchen, Peck's Arcade, and Dinosaur BBQ
I think Lirong went to too many Chinese restaurants. It is ridiculous.

<<<Farhad Mohsin>>>
I generally get seafood when outside. So Red and Blue and Plum Blossom restaurants make sense to me.
I've been to Red and Blue, I would like to try Plum Blossom once

<<<Rohit Vaish>>>
I have not been to any of these places, but I have heard good things about Plum Blossom.

<<<reed>>>
What about Korean food? I think they will like it

<<<Farhad Mohsin>>>
Also, I like the spicy-ness about Korean food, so Sunhee's does seem like a good option

<<<Lei Luo>>>
Does Lirong usually eat spicy food?

<<<Rohit Vaish>>>
Interesting. I have never tried Korean food, so it sounds like an exciting option.

<<<Farhad Mohsin>>>
Has anyone been to Sunhee's before? what are some interesting items there?

<<<Lei Luo>>>
It seems like we have Plum Blossom and Korean Food on the list.
I has been there a lot of times.

<<<reed>>>
The tofu soup there is my favorite

<<<Lei Luo>>>
I think their food is good, but each plate is pretty small

<<<reed>>>
Yeah

<<<Lei Luo>>>
Since there would be about six people for this dinner, I do not think Sunhee's Farm is good place to go.

<<<Farhad Mohsin>>>
We're not talking about Dino's at all though. Lei wanted to go to a non-chinese place. Does anyone think Dino's is a good idea?

<<<reed>>>
Dino is a considerable option for me

<<<Farhad Mohsin>>>
I've had vegetarian items there. They aren't my favorite, but they are not bad

<<<Lei Luo>>>
Farhad, are you a vegetarian?

<<<Farhad Mohsin>>>
No, but generally in restaurants, I prefer vegetarian or fish items. Which is why I initially preferred the chinese and korean restaurants

<<<reed>>>
Seems like we are ignoring Plum Blossom. I've never been there, is it good or not?

<<<Lei Luo>>>
I see. Plum Blossom does have a lot of Beijing food. The owner of this restaurant is from Taiwan. So the food there is not very authentic.
Compared to Red and Blue, Plum Blossom is a better place for six people.

<<<Rohit Vaish>>>
Stepping aside from the types of cuisine for a moment, let's discuss other factors like ambience and cost.

<<<Lei Luo>>>
Yeah, I heard Plum Blossom is very expensive

<<<Rohit Vaish>>>
I see.

<<<Lei Luo>>>
Although Lirong is going to cover the cost for us, should we take care about the cost?

<<<Farhad Mohsin>>>
Red and Blue is quite cheap. I have been there often, but if it's Lirong feeding us, maybe we should prefer an expensive place like Plum Blossom?

<<<Rohit Vaish>>>
Can't argue with that. :slightly_smiling_face:

<<<reed>>>
lol

<<<Lei Luo>>>
Okey, it seems like everyone except me is excited about Plum Blossom and Korean Food. I will make a compromise. (edited)
 
<<<Rohit Vaish>>>
Seems like Plum Blossom is something that we would all like to try.

<<<Lei Luo>>>
Sure.

<<<reed>>>
That is a good idea

<<<Farhad Mohsin>>>
Yes, It seems alright

<<<Lei Luo>>>
Let's do a quick voting.

<<<Farhad Mohsin>>>
Okay, let's just put down a formal ranking
As the ground truth
1. Sunhee's Farm and Kitchen (Korean Food)
2. Peck's Arcade (American Cuisine)
3. Red and Blue (Chinese)
4. Plum Blossom (Chinese)
5. Dinosaur BBQ (American BBQ)
For me, 4 > 1 > 3> 5 > 2

<<<reed>>>
4 1 5 3 2

<<<Lei Luo>>>
For me, 4 > 1 > 5 > 3 > 2

<<<Rohit Vaish>>>
I do not have a complete ranking, but I prefer 4 above all else.
So, 4 > (1,2,3,5)

<<<Farhad Mohsin>>>
Cool
Rohit, do you have time to join us for another session right away?

<<<Rohit Vaish>>>
Sure. I need to leave before 12 though. Sorry! :disappointed:
