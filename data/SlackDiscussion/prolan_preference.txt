<<<Lei Luo>>>
Let's start
I personally want to state that C++ is the best option compared to any other language we are listing here.

<<<Farhad Mohsin>>>
I think Python is always a good option as a first language. I remember thinking "this is almost English", and for someone young, that could give a fast learning rate.

<<<reed>>>
Yeah python is the most chosen languages compared to others for the newcomers

<<<Rohit Vaish>>>
I have used all five languages at various points. I feel that Matlab is the easiest to get started.
But it is much slower in comparison.

<<<reed>>>
Also if someone needs a better understanding of the logic and semantics of programming, Java is also a good option

<<<Farhad Mohsin>>>
Matlab is easy as well, I agree. One good thing for Matlab was the vast library and the really good documentation it comes with.


<<<Rohit Vaish>>>
Also, a Matlab license costs money unless one is at a university.

<<<Lei Luo>>>
For the short term learning a tool, Python is a good language. However, in the long term of prototyping research, especially related to memory and time complexity, python provide less controls compared to C++, C and Java

<<<Farhad Mohsin>>>
Prototyping essentially says that you are thinking of short term though

<<<Lei Luo>>>
I do not think Matlab is a programming language. It is hard for me to organize my scopes while using Matlab.

<<<reed>>>
Matlab is more like a tool for specific needs.

<<<Farhad Mohsin>>>
That might be because you started Matlab after you had learnt other language. While my personal choice is Python, I am yet to find a particular work that could not be done with Matlab. It has tools for everything.

<<<Lei Luo>>>
Why do no think prototyping is limited to a short-term prototyping? @Farhad Mohsin What if the project is immense and needs a lot of collaboration on it?

<<<Farhad Mohsin>>>
I think we're diverging on word meanings. Python is great for prototyping, because it's faster to write code and test ideas.

<<<Rohit Vaish>>>
Projects of that scale are a rare occurrence during freshman research. :slightly_smiling_face:

<<<reed>>>
I agree

<<<Farhad Mohsin>>>
Even for "immense projects", particularly for highschool kids, I would not say "scale" is a very important choice

<<<Lei Luo>>>
Lirong's daughter might be a genius. We have to admit that. (edited)

<<<Rohit Vaish>>>
A more concrete question could be the following: Which is the best language for machine learning/optimization research?
Or, which language would one use to create a platform like OPRA?

<<<Farhad Mohsin>>>
I feel like that's beside the point. Even for a genius it would take much longer to write a code for matrix multiplication in C rather than Python.

<<<Lei Luo>>>
Nope, I do not think we should think too intense into one field.
There are a lot of other fields requires programming languages, not even just talking about Computer Science

<<<Rohit Vaish>>>
Every language has its pros and cons. So, in order to come up with a ranking, I need to think from the standpoint of the fields of science that I am familiar with.

<<<Lei Luo>>>
C++ is much better than C because it provides a lot of libraries and still retains a good feature of C, such as pointers and memory controlling

<<<reed>>>
I don't think a research in freshman year will be that hard, python/Matlab should be enough

<<<Farhad Mohsin>>>
I think I agree with this comparison, that C++ is better than C
But still would maintain that Python or Matlab would give more flexibility than either of them

<<<Lei Luo>>>
If someone just learn Python in his/her freshman year, he/she might be so obsessed with it that he/she might be willing to learn other languages. I think starting from a basic, fundamental language is very necessary. (edited)

<<<Farhad Mohsin>>>
But they are doing it for a research project, right?
If it needs data analysis, python is quicker than C

<<<Lei Luo>>>
And he/she can use it for research as well as a way to practice

<<<Rohit Vaish>>>
We could compare languages in terms of:
--ease of learning
--speed of computation
--libraries
--active development and support community
--memory requirements

<<<Farhad Mohsin>>>
If it needs creating a webpage, python is quicker than C

<<<Lei Luo>>>
One stone to kill two birds

<<<Farhad Mohsin>>>
That probably gives another problem, Rohit. How do we rank the comparison conditions themselves? Does a easy language triumph over a speedy language?

<<<Rohit Vaish>>>
For the kind of stuff that I did in my freshman year, I found ease of learning and speed of computation to the most important factors. So, my ranking would be: Matlab > Python > {C,C++} > Java

<<<reed>>>
So Lei, which language you choose in terms of practice

<<<Rohit Vaish>>>
Right, there is no way to "rank" the factors. There are merely way to think about one's own preferences.
ways*

<<<Lei Luo>>>
@Farhad Mohsin Using your example of creating a webpage, python is a worse example because a lot of its libraries are packaged. If someone goes wrong with a minimal configuration in Python,  it was much harder to figure it out.
@reed I would choose C++
Just because it has pointers and memory controlling, fundamental skills everyone should learn. (edited)

<<<reed>>>
Nah she can just copy a template on stackoverflow
Won't be that hard

<<<Farhad Mohsin>>>
While I appreciate learning fundamental skills, for a project, I think I would agree with a lot of what I said before
Python > Matlab > C++ > C > Java
[Btw, @Lei Luo, it has been 15 minutes, we need to close this.] (edited)

<<<Lei Luo>>>
@Rohit Vaish @Farhad Mohsin I agree with you about we should think about some factors, but I have my own factors in thinking in this question.
Yeah, no problem

<<<reed>>>
Should we provide our own rankings?
Or we just close it

<<<Lei Luo>>>
My preference: C++ > Java > Python > C > Matlab
Yes

<<<reed>>>
Python > Matlab > C++  > Java> C

<<<Rohit Vaish>>>
For me, it is Matlab > Python > {C,C++} > Java

<<<Farhad Mohsin>>>
For me, Python > Matlab > C++ > C > Java

<<<Lei Luo>>>
(One thing to say before we close: I perform to be like C++. I personally prefer Python)
(I just want some diversities in the conversation)

<<<Rohit Vaish>>>
( :smile: )

<<<Farhad Mohsin>>>
I understood that :stuck_out_tongue:
Thanks again, everyone.

<<<Lei Luo>>>
Thank you!

<<<Rohit Vaish>>>
Thanks all!

<<<reed>>>
Do we need another conversation?

<<<Farhad Mohsin>>>
These should be enough now, I think

<<<Lei Luo>>>
Yep

<<<reed>>>
ok

<<<Lei Luo>>>
Thank you @reed
